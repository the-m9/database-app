1. to download the database-app download the bookbasedownload folder by going on https://kinolien.github.io/gitzip/ and pasting https://github.com/the-m9/database-app/tree/master/bookbasedownload into the top right search bar.

2. Extract the program using WinRar or 7-zip or any unzipper like that(I recommend WinRar, don't worry about the free trial thing).
